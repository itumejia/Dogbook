## Overview
### Description
This is a social network for dogs. In this app dogs owners will be able to create user profiles their dogs. In their profile they will be able to update photos of their dogs and everything they do. Also, each profile will have useful information for other dogs owners, like the breed, age, if the dog is looking for friends and contact information of the owner. This way, dogs will be able to connect with each others (as well as their owners). It also offers a nice way to connect with other people, the _Dogs Nearby Map_, which will have markers of posts that have a location attached, so that the users can find other users that are geographically close.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Social Networking
- **Mobile:** The mobile app would be the only way to access this social network (for now), here the users will have all the available features.
- **Story:** The users will be able to keep all the photos of their dogs along with the stories of those photos in one place. Also they will be able to connect with other users to set up dates to play with other dogs.
- **Market:** All dog owners love their dogs, but they also love other dogs. They will love to set up a social network account just for their dogs and to engage with other dogs and their owners.
- **Habit:** Every time an owner and its dog go out for adventure (go for a walk, travelling, etc), the owner will want to uoload a photo of that. Also, whenever they want to find new friends for their dogs, they will visit this app.
- **Scope:** The app will start focusing in attracting dog owners to create nice profiles for their dogs and in creating ways in which the users will be able to connect with each other.

## FBU Expectations Checklist

- [x] Your app has multiple views.
    *    The app has login, register, timeline, map and post details screens
- [x] Your app interacts with a database (e.g. Parse)
    *    The app uses a Parse database to store users and posts information
- [x] You can log in/log out of your app as a user
    *    The user has to login to access the app.
- [x] You can sign up with a new user profile
    *    The user is able to create a new account from the app
- [x] Your app integrates with at least one SDK (e.g. Google Maps SDK, Facebook SDK) or API (that you didnât learn about in CodePath)
    *    The app uses the Google Maps SDK
    *    The use of this SDK is different from what was seen in CodePath lab since the implementation of it is different (permissions are managed in a different way) and extra features are included like markers clustering, markers customization and a camera idle listener to load posts according to what is visible on the map.
- [x] Your app uses at least one gesture (e.g. double tap to like, e.g. pinch to scale) 
    *    The ViewPager introduce a gesture of scrolling horizontally to change the tab.
    *    Gestures of the ViewPager in the map fragement were disabled to let the user control the map freely.
    *    The user can pull down in the main feed to refresh.
- [x] Your app uses at least one animation (e.g. fade in/out, e.g. animating a view growing and shrinking)
    *    The pull to refresh gesture comes with an animation while the posts are being fetched.
    *    There is a transition animation when going from the login/register screen to the main activity.
- [x] Your app incorporates at least external library to add visual polish
    *    The app incorporates the Github library android-maps-utils to incorporate markers clustering to the map 
    *    The app incorporates the Github library android-PullRefreshLayout for the pull to refresg gesture/animation
    *    The app incorporates the Github library transition-button-android for the animation from login/register to the main activity
- [x] Your app provides opportunities for you to overcome difficult/ambiguous technical problems (more below)
    * The features that provided opportunities to overcome difficult problems were
        * The algorithm that fetches posts for the map only for a specific area depending on what is visible on the map.
        *    The app has a view pager that allows the user to move between the tabs of the main activity, involvement a special management of the fragments.
        * The markers clustering of the map.
